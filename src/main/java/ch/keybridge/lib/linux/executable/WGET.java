/**
 * Utility class to wrap the <code>wget</code> command in a Java process and
 * make that program accessible from within JavaEE ETL business logic.
 * <p>
 * GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the
 * Web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through
 * HTTP proxies.
 * <p>
 * Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background, while
 * the user is not logged on. This allows you to start a retrieval and
 * disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work. By contrast, most
 * of the Web browsers require constant user's presence, which can be a great
 * hindrance when transferring a lot of data.
 * <p>
 * Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local versions
 * of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the original
 * site. This is sometimes referred to as "recursive downloading." While doing
 * that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion Standard (/robots.txt). Wget can be
 * instructed to convert the links in downloaded files to point at the local
 * files, for offline viewing.
 * <p>
 * Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
 * connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep
 * retrying until the whole file has been retrieved. If the server supports
 * regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the download from where it
 * left off.
